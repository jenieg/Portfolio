Created a fully responsive personal portfolio website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and inline JavaScript. Highlights my latest projects and includes direct links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email for easy contact and exploration.

## Optimizations

I plan to come back and include a scroll-to-top button that displays after scrolling past the fold.
